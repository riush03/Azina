Source code of [Recycling Trashcan Locations website](https://RecyclingTrashCans.github.io).
Mapping recycling trashcan locations at the CSU Fresno / Fresno State campus. Providing 360 photos and videos for each location in case someone is interested or unsure about the specific location.

## Companion app accompanies website

This is also a companion website to an [Augmented Reality Map application (also open source)](https://github.com/RecyclingTrashCans/recycling-trashcan-armap/), and hosts the most current set of locations which are downloaded by the mobile app a few seconds after start. This way the locations can be updated without a new mobile app release.

## Adding your own locations to the companion app

Both the website and the app are capable of showing both recycling trashcan and generic locations. Please see instructions about how to add your own location [in the app's README](https://github.com/RecyclingTrashCans/recycling-trashcan-armap/blob/develop/README.md).
